Node-RED OpenAI API is a versatile and configurable Node-RED node designed for seamless integration with any OpenAI API compatible platform. This node empowers innovators and developers to effortlessly connect and orchestrate complex AI and AIoT workflows, leveraging Node-RED's sophisticated ecosystem. Ideal for enhancing IoT operations with advanced AI capabilities, this node serves as your gateway to applying the latest AI technology in an IoT context, facilitating innovative applications across diverse environments.

## Installation

### Via Node-RED Palette Manager

```text
@inductiv/node-red-openai-api
```

### Via NPM

```bash
cd $HOME/.node-red # or the location of your Node-RED configuration directory.
npm i @inductiv/node-red-openai-api
```

## Usage

After installation, find your node in the **AI** palette category labeled "OpenAI API". Here's how you can start integrating AI into your IoT projects:

1. Configure the node with your AI platform's API key (if required).
2. Send [OpenAI documented](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/) API service configuration paramaters to the node using the default `msg.payload` property, or confiure your desired incoming object property reference on the node itself.
3. Explore the [examples](./examples/) directory for sample implementations.

## Core Features

- **Seamless Integration**: Connect directly with OpenAI API compatible services without the hassle of complex coding or setup. Ideal for rapid prototyping and deployment in IoT contexts.
- **Configurable and Flexible**: Adapt to a wide range of project requirements, making it easy to integrate AI into your IoT solutions.
- **Powerful Combinations**: Utilize Node-RED's diverse nodes to build complex, AI-driven IoT workflows with ease.

## Release Notes (v1.103.0)

### Ehancements

- Upgraded the OpenAI API Library dependency from [v4.89.0](https://github.com/openai/openai-node/releases/tag/v4.89.0) to [v4.103.0](https://github.com/openai/openai-node/releases/tag/v4.103.0)

### Notable Features & Changes

- Full Model Context Protocol (MCP) tool support for the `responses` API.
- Added support for the new `container` endpoint.
- Added support for the new `containerFiles` endpoint.
- Added a simple MCP tool use example flow to the `examples` directory. See: [MCP Example](./examples/responses/mcp.json).

### Important Notice Regarding Compatibility

- **Backward Incompatible Changes**: Please be aware that v1.0 includes breaking changes that may affect existing implementations (v0.x.x instllations) due to the updated OpenAI NodeJS package:
  - The API call structure and parameters have been refined to align with the latest OpenAI specifications.
  - Some functions and settings from previous versions may no longer be compatible with this update.
  - List responses now exist at the top level of the `msg.payload` object; previously `msg.payload.data`.

I recommend reviewing existing flows and testing them with this new version in a development environment before updating to ensure a smooth transition. This will help you take full advantage of the enhanced features while managing any necessary adjustments in your existing applications.
